# chatGPT Wider Extension
Google Chrome Extension that gives control over the width of the chat. Created because the chat would spit out code blocks that would run out of view when plenty of website space is available.

#### Add to Chrome Manually:

1. Navigate to the relevent file location where you want to store the extension and run this command ``` git clone https://github.com/Bloomboi/chatGPTWiderExtension ```
2. Open Chrome and input `chrome://extensions` into the address bar.
3. On the extensions page, enable "Developer mode" using the toggle located in the top right.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button. This will then prompt the user to select the extension extension folder within the file explorer.
5. Once loaded into extensions, open a new tab with chatGPT ```https://chat.openai.com/```. 
6. Start a new chat or open a previous chat. Select the Chrome extensions button and click the Extension to enable it and set the width of the chat.
